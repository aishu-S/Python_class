HW2 is to learn to plot graphs and perform integral operations in python

hw2_10:
	 Program to calculate the period of the oscillator for given amplitude a, and Plot a graph of the period for amplitudes ranging from a = 0 to a = 2.

hw2_12:
	Calculate the Stefan Boltzmann constant, given Plank's constant, Boltz constant and the speed of light
