HW1 was used to learn to code in Python. This home work helped me understand the basics of the python coding using simple concepts like loops and recursion

hw1_1:
	program to calculate the time taken for a ball to land when thrown from the top of a tower with height h, and initial velocity u

hw1_12:
	Print the prime numbers between 1 and 10,000

hw1_13:
	Program to calculate the factorial, catalan value and GCD of the given numbers using recursion
